<p><b>Dig Dug</b> is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. 
<br>Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <b>Pooka</b> and <b>Fygar</b>, who will continually chase you around. 
<br>The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]</p>
