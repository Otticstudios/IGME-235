<p>To start off, when I looking at the original photo I knew that the double captions between the images were gonna be tough
<br> I also used grid as my Styling since I was just using it for the Tetris exercise.
<br> When Skecting out the layout. It went through a bunch of changes, and this is what I came up with.

<p>On the top is the design for the desktop layout and on the bottom is for mobile.
<br> I was really happy about how the Box for that little card section and the sticky note.
<br> My Goal is to just show people my Favorite game of all time.
