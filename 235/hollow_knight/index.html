<h2>Quote</h2>
<blockquote>
    The deeper I went into Hollow Knight, the more I was surprised at just how much content and freedom it has to offer. 
    <br>I could wander in basically any direction and find bosses to fight, upgrades to collect, and secrets to uncover. 
    <br>But whatâ€™s truly captivating about the exploring this long-dead kingdom is its atmosphere. Art, music, color tone, 
    <br>sound, and a million other little details.
