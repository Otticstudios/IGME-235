<h1>PHASE 1</h1>
<p>To start off, when I looking at the original photo I knew that the double captions between the images were gonna be tough
<br> I also used grid as my Styling since I was just using it for the Tetris exercise.
<br> When Skecting out the layout. It went through a bunch of changes, and this is what I came up with.
</p>

<p>On the top is the design for the desktop layout and on the bottom is for mobile.
<br> I was really happy about how the Box for that little card section and the sticky note.
<br> My Goal is to just show people my Favorite game of all time.
</p>
<h1>PHASE 2</h1>
<p>As Anakin Skywalker would say "This is where the fun Begins". I started by making sure the layout from the orginal PDF fit the Vibe <br>
I wanted for the site itself. So changing the fonts and the image behind the little Title Card thing. 
<br> I also completely wrote the main part of the page all by myself. Because its literally my favorite game of all time and I am very Normal about him.
<br> I also grabbed a couple of Images to fit the theme and added a pretty cool navbar. And getting plenty of Feedback helped me out a lot
<br> Really happy on how it turned out. Figuring out how to do the double caption stuff.</p>
<h1>GOAL</h1>
<p>The Goal of this site is to shine some light on my favorite video game of all time. 
    <br>My audience were people who didn't know much about the game series or character so I wanted to make it approachable. But not too overwhelming when I nerd out about it too much.
    <br> There are definetly more things I could've added but I'm still really glad how it turned out. 
    <br> My Favorite Part was picking out the fonts.
