<header><h1>The Idea</h1></header>
<p>The Idea is Simple. Using Circle blast as my basis I am going to make something similar to it using the basic code.<br>
The game will be called "Speen the bean". The name and concept is based off of this Vinesauce meme where he says spin in a funny voice <br>
Its a basic Top Down arcade game where you play as a Crocodile who does a spin attack to take down anthropromrphic green beans. Go for the high score and all that basic stuff.<br>
This is gonna be made for web desktops where you control the Crocodile using the mouse and by pressing the space bar you do a Crash Bandicoot Styled Spin attack. <br>
Doing the attack near the Green bean Enemies cuases them to explode and gain points.</p>
<p>I have no idea how I came up with this but Its funny</p>
